## Course Description

This course examines the ancient Greek novel, a genre of fictional prose from the period of the Roman Empire that dramatizes relationships that weather obstacles, like pirate kidnappings or suspicions of infidelity, to reach a satisfying, romantic conclusion. We will build your ancient Greek reading skills, learn about the genre, and explore its connection (or lack thereof?) to its historical environment. Our primary text will be Longus' *Daphnis and Chloe*, and our course's assignments will invite you to engage in detail with the text and others that make up the canon of Greek novels, including Chariton's *Callirhoe*, and Achilles Tatius' *Leucippe and Clitophon*, Xenophon of Ephesus' *Ephesiaca*, and Heliodorus' *Aethiopica*.
