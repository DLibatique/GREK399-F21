## Reading Journal: 25%

I will ask you to keep a journal of your progress as you read through the Greek assignments for the semester. For each class period that you prepare a Greek reading for, you are to create an entry in your journal that answers at least a few of the following questions (even if the answers are "no"):

* **Boring stuff**: What date is the target assignment for, what was the target assignment, and how much of it were you able to prepare?
* **Grammar/Syntax**: Any constructions that you found particularly difficult? Any that you found easy to understand?
* **Vocabulary**: Any vocab words that you found particularly interesting, for whatever reason? (Time permitting, why are these words interesting to you?)
* **Visual aids**: Include any diagrams or indentation schemes that you created to figure out the structure of the sentences in the assignment.
* **Tie it together**: Any overall thoughts on the assignment? Ideas that catch your eye, questions that arise as you read about the plot, etc.?

There is no minimum or maximum length for an entry, and you can format an entry in whatever way makes the most sense to you (full sentences / paragraphs, bullet points, etc.).

You can keep your journal in whatever way makes the most sense to you (a physical notebook, a Google Doc, etc.), but you will be required to submit your journal entry every class period, so take that into account when choosing a format.

There will be about 22 journal entries throughout the semester. Your journals will be graded on whether all 22 entries are complete on time or not. You will not be penalized for not preparing assignments in full or not having long answers to each question for every entry.

## Quizzes: 30%

About once per week over the weekend (a total of 11 times), you will complete a quiz aimed at analyzing the Greek readings that we discussed in class that week. You will choose a format for each quiz: either a 1-2pp. guided response to a question relating to the readings (with requirements for citing and translating the Greek), or a video/audio reading demonstration with word analyses. I will explain more about this in class. All quizzes will be open-note and open-resource, and there will be no time limit for any quiz. Your lowest grade out of the 11 quizzes will be dropped.

## Ancient Novel Book Report: 10%

In *Collected Ancient Greek Novels* (edited by B.P. Reardon), there are four (4) translated novels besides Longus' *Daphnis and Chloe* considered canonical for the genre:

* Chariton, *Chaereas and Callirhoe*
* Xenophon of Ephesus, *An Ephesian Tale* (or *Ephesiaca*)
* Achilles Tatius, *Leucippe and Clitophon*
* Heliodorus, *An Ethiopian Story* (or *Aethiopica*)

Your task for this assignment is to **read one of the four** (after reading Longus' *Daphnis and Chloe* as well in translation) and then **write a 3-5pp. double-spaced response** that answers the following questions:
* Who are the main characters of the novel, and what are the novel's major plot points?
* What are the major similarities between your chosen novel and *Daphnis and Chloe*?
* What are the major differences between your chosen novel and *Daphnis and Chloe*?

This assignment is due at any point up until the final day of classes (Friday, December 10), but I recommend completing it sooner rather than later so that it doesn't occupy the same workspace as your Unessay (on which see below).

## Unessay: 35%

As a semester-long project, you will complete an Unessay. See [the Unessay page](unessay) for details.

## Final Semester Grade

The final grade will be calculated as a percentage out of 100; then, it will be converted to a letter grade according to the following scheme:

A = 96-100%; A- = 90-95%  
B+ = 87-89%; B = 84-86%; B- = 80-83%  
C+ = 77-79%; C = 74-76%; C- = 70-73%  
D+ = 67-69%; D = 65-66%  
F = 0-64%

Grades ending in .45 or greater will be rounded up to the nearest whole number; grades ending in .44 or less will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
